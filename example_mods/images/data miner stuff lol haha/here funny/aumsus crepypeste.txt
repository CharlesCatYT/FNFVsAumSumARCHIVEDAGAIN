aUMsuMM LAOST EPISOAD by XxOMGaumsumrulesftwCaliousucks69xX

one day i decided to go to a second hand store and buy something
i saw a dvd with black sharpi clrudely writeen aumsum lost episode on it
i asked the chasier what it was and he said no, that thing? NO DONT BUY IT
i dit buy i anyway, and took it home
but once i turned back, the man DISAPPEARED with no trace
anyway my lil bro was a big fan of aumsum since he in started watching him in 2017
personallee i am not as a big fan of him
but i decided to watch this dvd with my lil bro big mistake
i put the dvd in the dvd playr and start the episode
it had no menu like dvd movies and shows sould, there was no intro either
it just went straight into the episode
aumsum looked different, he look diepressed with hyper realiztik eyes
then it started, aumsum said hi guys, i am sad, i am going to kill on of you just help me
me and my bro started crying and we were so scared
he was actually going to kill us.
I have no choice aumsum said.
you have to die
you never listened
LISTENEEEED TO WAT i thought
he grabbed out a god dam chainsaw 
and his eyes turned hyper realistic blood red with him crying blood 
with faint hiper realiztickk screams and crying in the bakgrond
he decided to run towards us in the tv screen
but before he could get a chanse reach us, the tv went to static
BUT THE STATIK HAD LOOK LIKE IT HAD BEEN HAS BLOOD RED
i took the dvd out and turns outt it hat melted in the dvd playar
i contacted the creator via email on the yt about page of aumsum
i never got a response until an hour later from chinmay shah
he said he had no affiiation with the dvd and the fact that someone like a sicko must've made the dvd
well, we got an answer at least
my brother came in and saw the email too
we just stood there
looking at each other confused on wat the hel we witnesssed
THE END
